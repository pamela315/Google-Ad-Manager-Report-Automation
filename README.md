# Google Ad Manager Automation 
Duration: Oct 2019 to Feb 2020

DFP Version: v201911 

This project is initiated by a client company. The ETL script is to call the Google Ad Manager API data, transform the result and finally push them to Google Sheets workbook. 
The function I use in Google Ad Manager API is the report service and line item service, under which impressions, clicks and CTR data are pulled out.

The package I used to push the data to Google Sheets is pygsheet. It is functional in clear by pasting a large set of data into the workbook without delay.
